When it comes to buying a computer and the huge amount of options out there, it seems like a very difficult thing to do, and indeed it is, even for expertise it is a pain to make a wise choise. However, in this article I will give you a little bit of context on the main components that need to be seen and to narrow those option based on your needs.

When I was a teenager I used to heard people using the term â€˜CPUâ€™ to refer the whole tower for desktop computers, and rapidly adopted the same term when talking about a PC. It was just until I got into college that I realised that CPU stands for Central Processing Unit and that this is the main component of the the computer, not because the others are not important but because without a CPU your device is useless(or can be used for other purposes out of the scope of this article).Â </p>
